Waifu themed text matching system, in development

Hello and welcome to my repo... This is basically the skeleton of the full project. You can't use it.
Though at the momment it's kind of useless so who would want to.

Anyway I'm trying to make an advanced text matching/text pattern finder, and text completer.


features I'm planning to add: 
- Words matching  
- or character matching, depending on if word is in responses 
- if no matching word is found, match characters instead 
- if characters do not resemble a word, exp: contain specific sets of characters depending on word length etc. then ignore it and try to find other words 
- if no valid words are found, mark the message as gibberish, and respond accordingly 
- optimize for speed and add up to 100 different responses 
- prediction of what the user might be trying to say based off of their message and internal data
